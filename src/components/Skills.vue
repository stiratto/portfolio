        <p class="text-start">
          With experience on NestJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL for DB's and Prisma as a ORM, i've built
          various E-Commerces, despite of the clients not continuing with the business running the
          sites are well built and have met the requirements of the clients.

        <p class="text-start">
          Just like I said, some of the E-Commerces are designed, maintained and developed by me.
          Using tools like React on its majority, VueJS as a second tool and Typescript under the
          hood because of its readability and static-typed-like developing.

          As a person that likes "freedom" when coming to personal environments and work
          environments, i've discovered Linux like 3-2 years ago and since, it has been my main
          operating system. I've explored various distros like GNOME, KDE and Arch which is my main
          distro right now with the i3 window manager. I have experience with bash, fish and others.

          I like technology in general and I just can't stop learning new things, thats why I
          started learning and despite it is not something i'm very experienced at, I have
          experience on cabling, routing, the OSI model, protocols, etcetera.
